In 1870, Sophus Lie was studying the symmetries of differential equations, 
which generally form "continuous" groups. The analogous problem for polynomials 
was solved by Galois previously, so there was incentive to solve the related 
problem for these new kinds of groups. This lead to a study of simplicity in 
these continuous groups. Lie understood these groups as groups generated by 
infinitesimal elements, which led him to believe that a group G should be 
generalised to consider infinitesimal elements. 

Today we separate the infinitesimal elements of a group G to form a Lie algebra g, 
which captures most of the important structures of G, but is easier to handle. 
This talk will focus on motivating Lie's definitions, and provide some techniques 
used to prove simplicity for Lie groups. As well, some specific examples such as 
O(n), SO(n), U(n), SU(n), and Sp(n) will be mentioned to illustrate the concepts 
presented.
