## Sequences

The set of natural numbers, including zero, is important in combinatorics. We
denote it by ``\mathbf{N} \cup \{0\} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}``.

A **sequence** ``(a_n)_{n\ge0}`` is a function ``\mathbf{N} \cup \{0\} \to
\mathbf{C}``. We denote by ``a_k`` the result of evaluating this function at
natural number ``k``.

An example of a sequence is the **triangular numbers** ``(T_n)_{n\ge0}``, which
counts the number of edges in a complete graph of order ``n``. We have, for
example, ``T_0 = 0``, ``T_1 = 0``, ``T_2 = 1``, ``T_3 = 3``, ``T_4 = 6``.

A common way to describe a sequence is by an explicit **closed form**, which
gives the function directly. For the aforementioned sequence of triangular
numbers, there is a simple closed form:

```math
T(n) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
```

Sometimes, a closed form may not be easy to find or may not be feasible to
compute, and we instead can use a **recurrence relation**. A recurrence
relation describes, recursively, the values of the sequence. For the triangular
numbers, we can find the following recurrence relation:

```math
T(n) = \begin{cases}
    0 & n = 0
    T(n-1) + n - 1 & n > 0
\end{cases}
```
