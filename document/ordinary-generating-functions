## Sequences

The set of natural numbers, including zero, is important in combinatorics. We
denote it by ``\mathbf{N} \cup \{0\} = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}``.

A **sequence** ``(a_n)_{n\ge0}`` is a function ``\mathbf{N} \cup \{0\} \to
\mathbf{C}``. We denote by ``a_k`` the result of evaluating this function at
natural number ``k``.
