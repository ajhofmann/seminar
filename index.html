<p><img src="/seminar/seminar.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is the website for the student-run University of Waterloo mathematics student seminars. We are a group of mathematics and computer science students who are interested in learning new topics and presenting our new knowledge to others.</p>
<p>We meet every Friday, generally in MC 4020. See our <a href="/seminar/faq">FAQ</a> for frequently asked questions, and the <a href="/seminar/archive">archive</a> for talks before todayâ€™s date. To browse talks by topic, see the <a href="/seminar/tags">tags</a> page. Here is a link to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/334849026859566/">facebook group</a>.</p>
<h2>Talk Submissions for Winter 2017</h2>
<p>Talk submissions for Winter 2017 are now open&#33; Please take a look at our <a href="/seminar/potential-topics">suggested topics</a>, or browse potential topics by <a href="/seminar/tags">tag</a>. To submit a talk, fill out our <a href="/seminar/submit-talk">form</a>. We recommend you read the <a href="/seminar/important-information">important information for speakers</a> first.</p>
</div><h2>Upcoming Talks</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Topic</th><th>Speaker</th><th>Location</th><th>Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th colspan="4">Talks on Friday December 2, 2016</th></tr><tr><td>How to Complicate Fourier Analysis</td><td>Mohamed Ayman</td><td>MC 4020</td><td>17:30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div class="markdown"><p>Fourier analysis was initially introduced as a way to study the thermodynamic heat equation. At its simplest, it is the study of how to represent functions as an  infinite sum of sines and cosines. However, the evil mathematicians felt that Fourier analysis was too simple and decided to steal it from the hardworking  physicists and expand on it. In addition, they decided to complicate it by introducing Harmonic analysis. So, what is the difference between Harmonic and  Fourier analysis? We say that Harmonic analysis is the process of representing functions on a locally compact group G as a sum of the characters of the group, and  Fourier analysis restricts this process to abelian groups.</p>
<p>In this talk I will introduce the Fourier series, the Fourier transform and how it applies to abelian groups. What about non-abelian groups, you might ask?  The answer is Harmonic analysis&#33; Finally, I will explain the role of Fourier transform in quantum mechanics, specifically how the Fourier transform interchanges  position and momentum space.</p>
</div></td></tr><tr><td>Voting with Homomorphic Encryption</td><td>Sidhant Saraogi</td><td>MC-4020</td><td>18:30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div class="markdown"><p>In light of the recently concluded Elections or as John Oliver would call it &quot;A horifying glimpse at Satan&#39;s Pinterest Board 2016&quot;, &quot;The One who must not be named&quot;  has repeatedly insinuated that the elections have been rigged. Our humble aim : Present a  voting scheme where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>each voter casts exactly one ballot. </p>
</li>
<li><p>voting is anonymous. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We delve into two areas on our way to prove our goal : </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Blind Signatures, which allow for anonymous voting </p>
</li>
<li><p>Pallier Cryptosystem, which gives us the ability to sum up the votes  even though they have been encrypted thus allowing the election to be  &quot;publicily audited&quot;. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We might also, if time permit, talk about more modern systems of enabling fair elections  that have even been implemented in real life.</p>
