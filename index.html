<p><img src="/seminar/seminar.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is the website for the student-run University of Waterloo mathematics student seminars. We are a group of mathematics and computer science students who are interested in learning new topics and presenting our new knowledge to others.</p>
<p>We meet every Friday, generally in MC 4020. See our <a href="/seminar/faq">FAQ</a> for frequently asked questions, and the <a href="/seminar/archive">archive</a> for talks before today’s date. To browse talks by topic, see the <a href="/seminar/tags">tags</a> page. Here is a link to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/334849026859566/">facebook group</a>.</p>
<h2>Talk Submissions for Winter 2017</h2>
<p>Talk submissions for Winter 2017 are now open&#33; Please take a look at our <a href="/seminar/potential-topics">suggested topics</a>, or browse potential topics by <a href="/seminar/tags">tag</a>. To submit a talk, fill out our <a href="/seminar/potential-topics/#request">form</a>. We recommend you read the <a href="/seminar/important-information">important information for speakers</a> first.</p>
</div><h2>Upcoming Talks</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Topic</th><th>Speaker</th><th>Location</th><th>Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th colspan="4">Talks on Friday November 25, 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Naïve Lie Theory</td><td>Aidan Patterson</td><td>MC 4020</td><td>17:30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div class="markdown"><p>In 1870, Sophus Lie was studying the symmetries of differential equations, which generally form &quot;continuous&quot; groups. The analogous problem for polynomials was solved by Galois previously, so there was incentive to solve the related problem for these new kinds of groups. This lead to a study of simplicity in these continuous groups. Lie understood these groups as groups generated by infinitesimal elements, which led him to believe that a group &#36;G&#36; should be generalised to consider infinitesimal elements. </p>
<p>Today we separate the infinitesimal elements of a group &#36;G&#36; to form a Lie algebra &#36;g&#36;, which captures most of the important structures of &#36;G&#36;, but is easier to handle. This talk will focus on motivating Lie&#39;s definitions, and provide some techniques used to prove simplicity for Lie groups. As well, some specific examples such as &#36;\mathrm&#123;O&#125;&#40;n&#41;&#36;, &#36;\mathrm&#123;SO&#125;&#40;n&#41;&#36;, &#36;\mathrm&#123;U&#125;&#40;n&#41;&#36;, &#36;\mathrm&#123;SU&#125;&#40;n&#41;&#36;, and &#36;\mathrm&#123;Sp&#125;&#40;n&#41;&#36; will be mentioned to illustrate the concepts presented.</p>

</div></td></tr><tr><td>Quandles: The Algebra of Knots</td><td>Brennen Creighton-Young</td><td>MC 4020</td><td>18:30</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div class="markdown"><p>One of the major goals of knot theory is to identify when two knots can be deformed continuously into each other. Though this is a straight forward idea, the rigorous definition of this, the notion of ambient isotopy, is practically unusable. This talk will provide a quick overview of basic knot theory and will work towards developing numerous algebraic strategies to identify when two knots are ambient isotopic. We will focus mostly on providing motivation for keis, an algebraic representation of knots, as well as their generalization, quandles. Quandles will prove to be not only helpful with respect to the goal of the classification of knots, but also as rich algebraic structures. The talk will involve small amounts of group theory, linear algebra and module theory.</p>
